# Basic-Encryption-and-Decryption-Tool
This Python code implements a Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. It shifts alphabetical characters by a user-defined value while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The program prompts the user for input and displays both the encrypted and decrypted messages, demonstrating basic encryption concepts.
